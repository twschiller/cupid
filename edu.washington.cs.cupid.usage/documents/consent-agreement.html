<h1>Cupid Data Collection Terms of Use</h1>

<p>This document describes how the Cupid development team at the
University of Washington ("Cupid Team") will treat the data provided
by individuals and organizations through the Cupid Data Collector.</p>

<ul>

  <li>A unique id is generated for every workstation (or Eclipse
  workspace) that submits data using the Cupid Data Collector. This
  session id is transmitted every time data is sent to the Cupid
  Team.</li>
  
  <li>The Cupid Team does not intend for the Cupid Data Collector to
  collect information that can uniquely identify you as an
  individual. However, it may inadvertently collect information that
  is included in plug-in metadata, which information may identify an
  individual or organization.</li>

  <li>The data that is being collected relates to how you are using
  Cupid and Eclipse. This includes, but is not limited to, length of
  time spent in a specific editor/view or perspective, capability
  invocation data, hashed qualified type names, plugin version
  numbers, wizard and view session data, etc.</li>
  
  <li>The Cupid Data Collector may collect and transmit the country
  where you are located.</li>

  <li>The Cupid Team will analyze data collected with the Cupid Data
  Collector for research purposes.</li>

  <li>The Cupid Team will publish summary reports based on the data
  obtained. These reports will be made available in machine readable
  format that will allow individuals and organizations to undertake
  further analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interactions with the Cupid Data Collector</h2>

<ul>

  <li>With your permission, the Cupid Data Collector will periodically
  transmit your usage data to the Cupid development team at the
  University of Washington. The first time it attempts to transmit the
  data, you will be requested to grant permission of transmission. If
  you decline the request, the Cupid Data Collector will stop
  functioning, until you decide to re-enable it. If you grant
  permission, you will have the option of allowing the Cupid Data
  Collector to automatically transmit data without further interaction
  or to request your permission each time it attempts to transmit
  data.</li>

  <li>At anytime, you may view the data that is being collected. To
  view your current information, go to the "Cupid Data Collection |
  Preview" preferences page.</li>

  <li>After providing your initial permission, you may discontinue use
  of the Usage Monitor by turning off the "Enable Capture" checkbox on
  the "Cupid Data Collection" preferences page.</li>

</ul>
